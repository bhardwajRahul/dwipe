> * **Firmware wipes (SATA/NVMe) are the most complete and fastest**: Hardware-accelerated erase operates at controller level (seconds to minutes), clears all drive mappings, but requires whole-device erase with no progress reporting or visible verification.
> * **Software wipes with one-pass zeros are sufficient**: Modern drives (post-2001) are reliably wiped with a single pass of zeros (NIST SP 800-88). Multi-pass modes are available for additional confidence but provide no additional security guarantee.
> * **Verification uses intelligent statistical sampling**: Even 1% verification samples across the entire disk via 100 sections, providing comprehensive coverage without full sequential read.

## Marquee Features

* **Interactive TUI with hot-swap detection** - Real-time device list updates as storage changes, newly added devices marked with **^**
* **Hardware-accelerated firmware wipes** - Full support for firmware-level secure erase operations (NVMe Sanitize/Format, SATA ATA Security Erase) that complete in seconds to minutes instead of hours
* **Multiple simultaneous wipes** - Start wipes on multiple devices at once with individual progress tracking and completion states
* **Persistent state tracking** - Wipe status survives reboots; partially wiped and completed states persist on the device (can resume wipes across power cycles)
* **Smart device identification** - Uses UUID/PARTUUID/serial numbers for stable device tracking across reconnections
* **Safety protections** - Prevents wiping mounted devices, detects overlapping wipes, supports device blocking, inline confirmation prompts
* **Intelligent verification with statistical sampling** - Fast verification that covers entire disk even at low percentages (1% verification samples from all 100 disk sections)
* **Direct I/O to disk** - Fast and efficient wiping that avoids page cache pollution with automatic slowdown/stall detection and graceful abort
* **Multiple color themes** - Terminal color themes designed for readability with context-sensitive visual feedback (mounted devices dimmed, active wipes bright)
* **Wipe history with logging** - Detailed wipe history viewer shows timestamps, filesystems, labels, and completion percentages with persistent records

## Requirements
- **Linux operating system** (uses `/dev/`, `/sys/`, `/proc/` interfaces)
- **Python 3.10 or higher**
- **Root/sudo privileges** (automatically requested when you run the tool)
- **lsblk utility** (usually pre-installed on most Linux distributions)
- **nvme-cli** - For NVMe operations (Sanitize/Format detection)
- **hdparm** - For SATA operations (ATA Security Erase detection)

**Optional (for clipboard copy in history screen):**
- **xclip** or **xsel** - For X11 clipboard (`apt install xclip` or `xsel`)
- **wl-clipboard** - For Wayland clipboard (`apt install wl-clipboard`)
- SSH sessions use OSC 52 terminal escape (no extra packages needed)

## Installation

* **Recommended (using pipx):** `pipx install dwipe`
* **Verify installation:** `dwipe --help`
* **Uninstall:** `pipx uninstall dwipe`

## Quick Start (please READ THIS, at least)
1. Install `dwipe`
1. Run `dwipe` from a terminal (`sudo` will be requested automatically)
1. Observe the context-sensitive help on the first line
1. Navigate with arrow keys or vi-like keys (j/k)
1. Press **?** for full help screen
1. **When you press `w` to wipe a drive,** you must type the abbreviation (e.g., `Rand`, `Zero`, `Crypto`); wipes are presented from least to most recommended, and the last one is marked with `*`. Normally, pick the last choice, but ...
1. **Drives and the OS often lie about drive type.** Outwit them both:
    * For spinning HDDs, **always** use `Rand` or `Zero` (interruptible, shows progress).
    * For SSDs, **always** use firmware wipes if available (faster, reaches hidden blocks).
1. **If a drive is 'Frozen'**, suspend your system briefly and resume; `dwipe` auto-detects the resume and rescans. Or press `r` to rescan manually. The drive should come back unfrozen.
1. **If a drive is 'Locked'**, you must unlock it manually (see "Unlock Locked Device" section below). If `dwipe` locked it, the password is `NULL`; otherwise use the password that locked it.
1. **Hot-swap workflow for SATA drives**: `DEL` to detach, physically swap drives, then `r` to rescan (if needed).


## Features

`dwipe` provides comprehensive disk wiping capabilities with safety features:

* **Smart device display** - Shows disks and partitions with labels, sizes, types, and vendor/model information to help identify devices correctly
* **Safety protections** - Prevents wiping mounted devices, detects overlapping wipes, supports manual disk blocking
* **Hot-swap detection** - Updates the device list when storage changes; newly added devices are marked with **^** to make them easy to spot
* **Multiple simultaneous wipes** - Start wipes on multiple devices at once, with individual progress tracking and completion states
* **Flexible wipe modes** - Choose between Rand, Zero, Rand+V (with auto-verify), or Zero+V (with auto-verify)
* **Device filtering** - Filter devices by name/pattern using regex in case of too many for one screen
* **Stop capability** - Stop individual wipes or all wipes in progress
* **Disk blocking** - Manually block disks to prevent accidental wiping (blocks hide all partitions)


> **Note:** `dwipe` shows file system labels, and if not available, the partition label. It is best practice to label partitions and file systems well to make selection easier.

## Usage

Simply run `dwipe` from the command line without arguments: `dwipe`

### Command-Line Options

### Color Legend

`dwipe` uses color coding to provide instant visual feedback about device and operation status:

- **Dimmed (gray)** - Mounted or blocked devices (cannot be wiped)
- **Default (white)** - Ready to wipe, idle state, or previously wiped (before this session)
- **Bright cyan/blue + bold** - Active wipe or verification in progress (0-100% write, v0-v100% verify)
- **Bold yellow** - Stopped or partially completed wipe
- **Bold green** - ✅ Successfully completed wipe in THIS session (ready to swap out!)
- **Dimmer green** - ✅ Successfully completed wipe in previous session .
- **Bold orange** - Newly inserted (hot-swapped) device
- **Bold red** - Destructive operation prompts (wipe confirmation)

### Color Themes

`dwipe` supports multiple color themes for improved visibility and aesthetics.

**Available themes:**
- `default` - Terminal Default (basic ANSI colors)
- `dark-mono` - Dark Mono (almost-white on almost-black with bright colors)
- `light-mono` - Light Mono (almost-black on almost-white with bright colors)
- `solarized-dark` - Solarized Dark palette
- `solarized-light` - Solarized Light palette (for light terminal backgrounds)
- `gruvbox` - Gruvbox Dark palette
- `nord` - Nord palette

**Changing themes:**
- Press **t** from the main screen to open the theme preview screen
- The theme screen shows color examples for each color purpose (DANGER, SUCCESS, WARNING, etc.)
- Press **t** while on the theme screen to cycle through available themes and preview them live
- Press **ESC** or **ENTER** to return to the main screen
- Selected theme is saved and persists across sessions

**Theme features:**
- Yellow/warning color for stopped wipes (state **s**) - highly visible even when not selected
- Red/danger color for wipe confirmation prompts
- Coordinated color palettes designed for terminal readability

### Device State Values

The **STATE** column shows the current status of each device:

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **-** | Device is ready for wiping |
| **^** | Device is ready for wiping AND was added after `dwipe` started (hot-swapped) |
| **Mnt** | Partition is mounted or disk has mounted partitions - cannot be wiped |
| **N%** | Wipe is in progress (shows percentage complete, 0-100%) |
| **vN%** | Verification is in progress (shows percentage complete, v0-v100%) |
| **STOP** | Wipe or verification is being stopped |
| **s** | Wipe was stopped - device is partially wiped (can restart or verify) |
| **W** | Wipe was completed successfully (can wipe again or verify) |
| **Blk** | Disk is manually blocked - partitions are hidden and cannot be wiped |
| **Unbl** | Disk was just unblocked (transitory state) |

### Available Actions

The top line shows available actions. Some are context-sensitive (only available for certain devices):

| Key | Action | Description |

> **Note:** If OSC 52 doesn't work with your terminal, the text still appears on screen for manual selection. For tmux, enable clipboard with `set -g set-clipboard on` in your `.tmux.conf`.

### Wipe Types

`dwipe` supports firmware wipes (hardware-accelerated) and software wipes. Firmware wipes require the `--firmware-wipes` or `-F` flag. Tables below list wipe methods from most desirable (Rank 1) to least.

#### NVMe Drives

| Rank | Abbrev | Official Name | Remarks |
|------|--------|---------------|---------|
| 1 | Crypto | Sanitize Cryptographic Erase | Fastest; erases encryption keys; instant data invalidation |
| 2 | Block | Sanitize Block Erase | Fast; resets all blocks to deallocated state |
| 3 | FCrypto | Format with Crypto Erase | Fast; reformats namespace with key erasure |
| 4 | FErase | Format with User Data Erase | Fast; reformats with simple data erase; less thorough than crypto |
| 5 | Ovwr | Sanitize Overwrite | Minutes; writes pattern to all blocks; most thorough but rarely needed |
| 6 | Rand | Software Random Write | Fallback; writes random data via software; hours for large drives |
| 7 | Zero | Software Zero Write | Fallback; writes zeros via software; verifiable but slower |

#### SATA SSDs (with crypto/sanitize features)

| Rank | Abbrev | Official Name | Remarks |
|------|--------|---------------|---------|
| 1 | SCrypto | Sanitize Cryptographic Erase | Fastest; erases encryption keys; requires SANITIZE feature |
| 2 | Enhanced | ATA Security Erase Enhanced | Fast; vendor-specific deep erase with crypto key destruction |
| 3 | SBlock | Sanitize Block Erase | Fast; resets blocks to factory state; requires SANITIZE feature |
| 4 | Erase | ATA Security Erase Normal | Minutes; writes zeros to all sectors; widely supported |
| 5 | SOverwrite | Sanitize Overwrite | Minutes; overwrites with pattern; requires SANITIZE feature |
| 6 | Rand | Software Random Write | Fallback; can't reach wear-leveled or remapped blocks |
| 7 | Zero | Software Zero Write | Fallback; can't reach wear-leveled or remapped blocks |

#### SATA HDDs (spinning drives)

| Rank | Abbrev | Official Name | Remarks |
|------|--------|---------------|---------|
| 1 | Rand | Software Random Write | Preferred; interruptible, resumable, shows progress |
| 2 | Zero | Software Zero Write | Preferred; interruptible, resumable, fast verification |
| 3 | Enhanced | ATA Security Erase Enhanced | Slow (hours); not interruptible; no progress; same result as software |
| 4 | Erase | ATA Security Erase Normal | Slow (hours); not interruptible; no progress; same result as software |

> **Note:** HDDs don't have wear leveling or hidden blocks, so software wipes are equally thorough as firmware wipes but offer better control (progress, pause/resume, interruptibility).

#### Partitions and USB/Thumb Drives

| Rank | Abbrev | Official Name | Remarks |
|------|--------|---------------|---------|
| 1 | Rand | Software Random Write | Preferred; unpredictable pattern; statistical verification |
| 2 | Zero | Software Zero Write | Simpler; fast verification (fails on first non-zero byte) |

> **Notes:**
> - Firmware wipes show only methods supported by each drive (see FwCAPS column).
> - Firmware wipes include automatic spotcheck verification.
> - The `+V` suffix enables automatic verification after software wipes. Without `+V`, press **v** to verify manually.
> - Multi-pass software wipes (2 or 4) alternate zero/random patterns, ending on your selected mode.
> - USB drives and partitions lack firmware erase—only software wipes available.

### Resuming Stopped SOFTWARE Wipes

Stopped wipes (state **s**) can be resumed by pressing **w** on the device. Choose the same type of wipe or it will start over at 0% complete.

**How Resume Works:**
- Preserves the original wipe mode (Rand or Zero) from when the wipe was started
- Uses the **current** passes setting to determine how much more to write
- Continues from the exact byte offset where it marked that stopped (rounded to buffer boundary). "Marks" are written about every 30s so for non-gracefully ended wipes, the position may be as much as 30s (or somewhat more) from the last wiped disk blocks.

**Resume Examples:**

| Stopped At | Current Passes | What Happens |
|------------|----------------|--------------|
| 50% | 1 pass | Resumes: writes remaining 50% |
| 150% (1.5 of 4 passes) | 1 pass | Already complete (150% > 100%) |
| 150% (1.5 of 4 passes) | 4 passes | Resumes: writes 2.5 more passes (150% → 400%) |
| 100% (1 pass complete) | 2 passes | Resumes: writes pass 2 (100% → 200%) |

**Benefits:**
- Change passes setting before resuming to finish faster (reduce) or add more passes (increase)
- No need to restart from beginning
- Progress marker updated every 30 seconds, so resume works even after crashes or power loss
- Automatic validation prevents corrupted final patterns

### Software Wipe Verification Strategy

Software wipes use intelligent verification with statistical analysis and fast-fail optimizations. Verification is **configurable and optional**.

**Smart Sampling:**
- Divides disk into 100 equal sections
- Randomly samples configurable percentage (1%, 3%, 10%, 30%, 100%) from EACH section
- Ensures complete disk coverage even with 1% verification
- Set verification percentage with `--verify-pct` command-line option (saved as preference)

**Pattern Detection:**
- **Zero verification**: Fails immediately on first non-zero byte (fast!)
- **Random verification**: Statistical analysis of byte distribution
  - Tests if byte distribution is uniform (all byte values 0-255 appear fairly equally)
  - Fast-fails periodically if non-random pattern detected
  - Checks for evidence of randomness to distinguish from structured data

**Verification Modes:**
1. **Automatic verification** (after wipe): Use a mode with `+V` suffix (Rand+V or Zero+V) and set verify % > 0
2. **Manual verification** (press **v**): Verify previously wiped devices or detect pattern on unmarked disks (requires verify % > 0)
3. **Unmarked disk detection**: Can verify disks with no filesystem to detect if all zeros or random
   - If passes, writes marker as if disk had been wiped
   - Useful for detecting pre-wiped drives or verifying manufacturer erasure

**Verification States:**
- ✓ (green checkmark) - Verification passed
- ✗ (red X) - Verification failed
- No symbol - Not verified
- During verify: **vN%** shows progress (v0% to v100%)

**Why statistical sampling is better than sequential:**
- Statistical sampling with 100 sections provides better coverage than sequential read at same percentage
- Detects problems faster (could hit bad sector in early sections)
- Statistical analysis actually validates randomness (sequential can't do this)
- Much faster than 100% sequential verification

### Firmware Wipe Verification Strategy

Firmware wipes (SATA/NVMe secure erase) use an **unconditional spotcheck verification** that is **performed automatically for all firmware wipes**. This verifies that the hardware erase command actually executed.

**Spotcheck Approach:**
- Before the wipe: Write test data blocks at three strategic locations (front, middle, tail of drive)
- Execute the firmware erase command at the controller level
- After the wipe: Read those three test locations and verify they no longer contain the original data
- If any test block still contains similar data, the erase has failed and is reported

**Why Spotchecks Are Effective:**
- Proves the drive's internal erase actually processed (not just a command acknowledgment)
- Three-location strategy (0%, 50%, 100% of drive) ensures coverage across the entire device
- Catches firmware bugs or hardware failures that might claim success but do nothing
- Much faster than sequential verification (only 3 blocks read instead of percentage of whole drive)
- **Mandatory and unconditional**: No user configuration or additional verification step needed

**Important Note:** Firmware wipes do not show percentage-based verification like software wipes. The spotcheck happens silently as part of the wipe operation, and success/failure is recorded in the persistent wipe state marker.

### Progress Information

When software wiping a device, `dwipe` displays:
- **Elapsed time** - Time since wipe started (e.g., 1m18s)
- **Remaining time** - Estimated time to completion (e.g., -3m6s)
- **Write rate** - Current throughput (e.g., "45.2MB/s")
- **MaxSlowDown** - Ratio of Fastest/Slowest write speed (e.g, ÷2). If over threshold, the write job stops.
- **MaxWriteDelay** - Largest write delay detected (e.g., 𝚫122ms). If over threshold, the write job stops.

### Persistent State

The **W** (wiped) and **s** (partially wiped) states are persistent across reboots. This is achieved by writing metadata to the first 16KB of the device:
- First 15KB: zeros
- Next 1KB: JSON metadata (timestamp, bytes written, total size, mode, verification status)

When a device with persistent state is displayed, additional information shows:
- When it was wiped and the completion percentage
- Verification status: ✓ (passed), ✗ (failed), or no symbol (not verified)


### The Help Screen
When **?** is typed, you can see the available keys and command-line options with their current settings.

### Navigation

You can navigate the device list using:
- **Arrow keys** - Up/Down to move through the list
- **Vi-like keys** - j (down), k (up), g (top), G (bottom)
- **Page Up/Down** - Quick navigation through long lists

## Device Filtering

The **/** key activates incremental search filtering with vim-style behavior:

**How it works:**
- Press **/** to start filtering
- Type your regex pattern - the device list updates **as you type** (real-time filtering)
- Your cursor position is shown with **|** in the header
- **Arrow keys**, **Home**/**End**, and **Backspace** work for editing
- **ENTER** to accept the filter
- **ESC** to cancel and restore the previous filter

**Filter Examples:**

The filter supports regex patterns. Here are some useful examples:

```
/sda           # Show only sda and its partitions
/sd[ab]        # Show sda, sdb and their partitions
/nvme          # Show all NVMe devices
/nvme0n1p[12]  # Show only partitions 1 and 2 of nvme0n1
/usb           # Show devices with "usb" in their labels
```

Press **ESC** from the main screen to clear the filter and return to showing all devices.

**Note:** Invalid regex patterns are ignored - the filter stays at the last valid pattern while you type.

## Security Considerations

**Important limitations of software wipes:**

- `dwipe` supports multi-pass wiping with alternating patterns, but does not implement specific DoD 5220.22-M or Gutmann certified pattern sequences
- More than adequate for **personal and business data** that doesn't require (antiquated) certified destruction
- **NOT suitable for** classified, top-secret, or highly sensitive data requiring certified pattern-specific wiping with compliance certificates
- **SSD considerations**:
  - Modern SSDs use wear-leveling and may retain data in unmapped blocks
  - TRIM/DISCARD may prevent complete data erasure
  - For SSDs, consider manufacturer's secure erase utilities for maximum security
  - Random mode may not provide additional security over zeros on SSDs

**Best practices:**
- Verify device labels and sizes carefully before wiping
- Use the **Block** feature to protect critical disks
- Consider encryption for sensitive data as the primary security measure

## Troubleshooting

### dwipe won't start
- **Error: "cannot find lsblk on $PATH"** - Install `util-linux` package
- **Permission denied** - `dwipe` automatically requests sudo; ensure you can use sudo

### Terminal display issues
- **Corrupted display after crash** - Run `reset` or `stty sane` command
- **Colors don't work** - Ensure your terminal supports colors (most modern terminals do)

### Wipe issues
- **Can't wipe a device** - Check the STATE column:
  - **Mnt** - Unmount the partition first: `sudo umount /dev/sdXN`
  - **Blk** - Press **b** to unblock
  - **Busy** - Another partition on the disk is being wiped
- **Wipe is very slow** - Normal for large drives; check write rate to verify progress
- **Wipe seems stuck** - Most likely due to bad disks; Direct I/O makes progress almost constant on good disks.

---
### Firmware Wipe Considerations

Firmware wipes (SATA/NVMe secure erase operations) have different characteristics than software wipes:

**Frozen Drives:**
- SATA drives are typically frozen by the BIOS/UEFI during POST as a security measure
- This is a drive-level security feature, not a `dwipe` limitation
- **Solution**: Suspend your system briefly and resume; `dwipe` auto-detects the resume and rescans (or press **r** manually). The suspend/resume power-cycles the SATA link which clears the freeze.
- If the drive remains frozen after suspend/resume, try a full power-off (10+ minutes to drain drive capacitors) followed by boot and rescan

**Device Quirks and Compatibility:**
- Storage devices have various firmware implementations and hardware quirks that affect secure erase operations
- Some drives may not fully support certain sanitize operations, have timing issues, or exhibit unexpected behavior
- `dwipe` cannot guarantee that all devices will be successfully wiped—some hardware simply may not cooperate with erase commands
- Always verify a drive after wiping (use **v** key) to confirm the erase actually completed
- For mission-critical data destruction on quirky hardware, consider using manufacturer-specific secure erase tools as a fallback

### Dealing with Bad or Failing Disks

dwipe includes built-in protections for problematic storage devices:

**Automatic Error Handling.** When encountering disk errors during wiping:
*   Consecutive write errors: Wipe aborts after 3 consecutive failed writes
*   Total error threshold: Wipe aborts after 100 total write errors
*   Automatic retry: On write failure, device is automatically closed and reopened (transient error recovery)
*   File descriptor recovery: Bad FD states are detected and handles are refreshed

**Stall and Slowdown Detection.** dwipe monitors write performance and can abort problematic operations:
*   Stall detection: Aborts if no progress for 5 minutes (configurable)
*   Slowdown detection: Measures baseline speed during first 5 seconds, aborts if speed drops below threshold (e.g.,  1/4 of baseline)
*   Progress tracking: Continuous monitoring ensures writes are actually reaching the device

**If a Wipe Gets Stuck...** If a wipe appears frozen or unresponsive:
*   First attempt: Press s to gracefully stop the selected wipe
*   Wait patiently: Some disk operations can take minutes to timeout at the kernel level
*   If still stuck: Press S (Shift+s) to stop ALL wipes
*   Last resort: If the interface is completely frozen:
    *   Press Ctrl-Z to suspend `dwipe`
    *   In the terminal, run: `sudo pkill -f "python.*dwipe" (targets only dwipe processes)`
    *   Run reset to restore terminal if display is corrupted

**Preventing Issues with Problematic Media.** For known bad disks or questionable hardware:
*   Start with verification: Press v first to test readability
*   Use lower speeds: Enable dirty page throttling (d key) to reduce I/O pressure
*   Monitor system logs: Check dmesg -w in another terminal for disk errors
*   Consider hardware issues: USB enclosures, cables, and controllers often cause issues

**Common Disk Error Patterns**
*   USB connection drops: dwipe will detect and attempt recovery
*   Bad sectors: Errors will be counted; job aborts if excessive
*   Controller timeouts: Kernel may hang; stall detection should trigger
*   Full disk: Write past end-of-device errors are handled gracefully

**Recovery After Abort.** If a wipe aborts due to disk errors:
*   Device state shows s (stopped/partial)
*   You can attempt to resume (w) - may succeed if error was transient
*   Or verify (v) to see what was actually written
*   Consider replacing the disk if errors persist

Note: Some disks are fundamentally broken and cannot be reliably wiped. dwipe will protect itself and your system, but cannot fix hardware failures.

#### Recommendations for SATA Wiping over USB
* Requirement 1: SAT (SCSI-ATA Translation) Support

  * The USB bridge must be capable of "passing through" ATA commands.
  * The Test: If the app can see the "Security" section in the drive details, the bridge supports SAT.

* Requirement 2: Stable Power
  * Firmware wipes (especially on 3.5" HDDs) draw significant peak power.
  * The Risk: If a USB-powered "bus-only" cable is used, the voltage might sag during the wipe, causing the bridge to reset and "brick" the drive in a locked state.
  * The Recommendation: Always use an externally powered USB dock for 3.5" drives.

* Requirement 3: Command Timeout Integrity
  * The bridge must not have an aggressive "Watchdog Timer."
  * The Risk: Some bridges disconnect if they don't see "data" for 60 seconds. During a firmware wipe, the drive is busy internally and doesn't send data.
  * The Recommendation: Use high-quality chipsets like ASMedia (1153E) or JMicron (JMS578).

##### Unlock Locked Device
```
sudo hdparm --user-master u --security-unlock NULL /dev/sdX
sudo hdparm --user-master u --security-disable NULL /dev/sdX
```
